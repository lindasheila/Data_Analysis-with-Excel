The dataset contains temperature measurements recorded in degrees Celsius. In this exercise, a new column is added to the left of the existing temperature column to display the corresponding Fahrenheit values, calculated using the formula:
F=1.8C+32


After performing the conversion, the updated dataset is exported as a CSV file for further analysis.
